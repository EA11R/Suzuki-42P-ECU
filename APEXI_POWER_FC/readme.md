Converison of RB26 Harness to work with the F6A engine 

Basic knowledge about how similar inline 6 engines are to inline 3

I6 : Piston 1,6 2,5 3,4 are paired together 
I3 : Piston 1,3,2 each on it’s own 

Firing order of an I6: 1-5-3-6-2-4 every cycle 

Firing order of an I3 : 1-3-2 every cycle 

so we understand that the I6 fires 6 times every full rotation
and the inline 3 fires 3 times every full rotation
so those aren’t matching in terms of fire

However if we skip 1 coil (piston in the cycle ) we get the half

(1-skip-3-skip-2-skip) we right now have a suitable ignition!
