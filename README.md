# Suzuki-42P-ECU
The #1 source of Suzuki mask MPU information and resources 
 ## image of board

 the board utilzes a 8-bit cpu which is masked it's believed to be close 
 the pinout has been previously figured out by (rhinopower)

 ## pinout of the cpu

this is a pinout of the ecu pulled over by a scope and some testing 
I took the neccesary pins of it to work and left over things such as temp sensors 
it can be pulled out of the ecu but I honestly can't tell how to turn that digital signal into numbers without further testing
the IC before it however has a gradiant signal of voltage via the variant resistance of the temp thermos 
I have took the neccesary pins to hook the ECU alongsite a daughter card that uses speeduino
