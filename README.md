# Suzuki-42P-ECU
The #1 source of Suzuki mask MPU information and resources 
 ## image of board 
 ![alt text](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/1ydCnrPaT7p2.jpg)
 the board utilzes a 8-bit cpu which is masked it's believed to be close 
 the pinout has been previously figured out by (rhinopower) 
 www.rhinopower.org/ECUs/RomReader/Romreader.html
 ## pinout of the cpu 
  ![alt text](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/Y1y29Iqc7OYW.jpg?o=1)
 
this is a pinout of the ecu pulled over by a scope and some testing 
I took the neccesary pins of it to work and left over things such as temp sensors 
it can be pulled out of the ecu but I honestly can't tell how to turn that digital signal into numbers without further testing
the IC before it however has a gradiant signal of voltage via the variant resistance of the temp thermos 
I have took the neccesary pins to hook the ECU alongsite a daughter card that uses speeduino

## Possible piggy-back ECU's
1- E-manage (TRUST)

2- HKS F-con (ALL)

3- Speeduino ( can be standalone with some changes)

4- any ECU that can get a squarewave signal and a choice of cylinders.

Current ("Free of charge") project

1- an open source ECU adapter for speeduino boards & harness how to and links to purchace parts 

2- Adapter PCBS for popular ecus with an added pip373 slot for distrubtor ignition!

3- Modren Daughtercard using oem CPU + speeduino (atmega 2560) , for better ignition timing , full fuel control
