## FILE TYPE 

Those are the files that are normally uploaded onto the 27C256 Which are binary and require a chip burner capable to upload roms

## TOOLSET FOR MODIFYING TUNES 

1- a knowledge of some offset or / an actual ROM emulator to do real time tuning 

2- a rom burner 

3- a head gasket or an actual tuner lol 

4- a friend with a tuned chip to copy.

## KNOWN WAYS OF READING ROM 
www.rhinopower.org/ECUs/RomReader/Romreader.html

I never tried to put a blank chip in the MTR40BB to see if it actually writes it if it's blank

But If I ever have the chance to get my hands on a N1 , N2 ECU

I would surely build a rom Reader for that!
